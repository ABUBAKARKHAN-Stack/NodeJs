 # Databases Introduction

## Why Do We Need Databases?
Databases are essential for storing, managing, and retrieving structured or unstructured data efficiently. They help in:
- Persistent data storage
- Quick access and retrieval
- Managing large datasets
- Ensuring data consistency and security

## SQL vs NoSQL

| Feature        | SQL (Relational DB) | NoSQL (Non-Relational DB) |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| Structure    | Table-based (Rows & Columns) | Document, Key-Value, Column-Family, Graph |
| Schema      | Fixed Schema | Flexible Schema |
| Scalability  | Vertical Scaling | Horizontal Scaling |
| Transactions | Supports ACID Transactions | Supports BASE Transactions (Eventual Consistency) |
| Examples    | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite | MongoDB, Firebase, Cassandra |

## Databases Used in This Repository
In this Node.js repository, we will be using both SQL and NoSQL databases, along with ORM/ODM tools:

- **SQL Database**: MySQL
- **NoSQL Database**: MongoDB
- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: Prisma, Drizzle
- **ODM (Object-Document Mapping)**: Mongoose

## Covered Topics
This repository will cover the following:
- Setting up databases (MySQL & MongoDB)
- Connecting Node.js with databases
- Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Using Prisma & Drizzle ORM for SQL databases
- Using Mongoose ODM for MongoDB
- Real-world examples of database interactions
